Q2. 
The predator and prey start at the same initial population, and the number of 
prey isn't high enough to support the population of predator. This causes the 
predator population to fall and the prey population can grow without enough 
predators to eat them. This causes an abundance of prey which will allow the 
predator population to grow. Once the predator population grows, they eat too 
many prey and the prey population will fall. This will cause a decline in 
predator population, the cycle repeats.

This means that the predator population lags behind the prey population in 
growth and decline.

Q4.
x_stat, the stable prey population is 30 when y_stat, the stable predator
population is 15. If I run the first program from this assignment setting the 
initial populations as the stable solutions found by the second program and 
plot the results in phase space (plot2), I get a single point on the plot. This
confirms that the values are stable.
The steady state conditions are when both dy/dt and dx/dt are simultaneously 
zero. This occurs when y = ALPHA/BETA = 1.5/0.1 = 15 and x = GAMMA/DELTA = 
3.0/0.1 = 30.

The other solution for steady state can only be found in this system when x and
y are both zero, which our system will never reach due to the dynamics of the
system.
